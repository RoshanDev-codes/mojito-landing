type: "chars, words" = “Please cut my text into words and also into letters, so I can choose to animate either whole words or individual letters with GSAP.”

Comma = "give me ALL these split types together"
​

type: "chars, words" uses a comma-separated string because SplitText accepts multiple split types in a single config object.

Why this syntax?
SplitText supports 4 split modes:

"lines" - splits into lines

"words" - splits into words

"chars" - splits into characters

"words,chars" - does both words AND chars

The comma = "do multiple at once"

so what is the difference in gsap.from and gsap.to ?

GSAP .from() vs .to() - Core Difference
.to(): Starts from current position → animates TO your target values.
.from(): Starts from your values → animates TO current position.

Current element state: yPercent: 0 (visible on screen)

gsap.to(heroSplit.chars, { yPercent: 100 })
↓
START: y=0 (visible)    →    END: y=100 (slides DOWN off screen)

gsap.from(heroSplit.chars, { yPercent: 100 })
↓
START: y=100 (off screen) →    END: y=0 (slides UP into view)

"When video loads, tell ScrollTrigger: 'As user scrolls from start→end, move video timeline from 0s→end automatically.'


1. Wait for video to load ("onloadedmetadata")
2. Tell timeline: "Animate video.currentTime from 0 → full length"
3. ScrollTrigger: "As user scrolls, update currentTime to match scroll position"
4. Result: Video "plays" by changing frames with scroll!

With "-=0.5"
"-=0.5" means:
“Start this 0.5 seconds before the previous animation ends.”

So grid animation overlaps the end of the title animation.

Timeline now:

text
[ title animation (1s) ]
          [ grid animation (1s) ]
time ------>
0s        0.5s                1.5s
So the “sauce” is:

"+=X" → start X seconds after previous animation’s end.

"-=X" → start X seconds before previous animation’s end (overlap).

No 3rd arg → start exactly at previous animation’s end.

In plain words for your code:

Animate the heading words; when they are halfway done (0.5s left), start fading in the top and bottom grid items, so everything feels more continuous and not strictly one-after-another.
