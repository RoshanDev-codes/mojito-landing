TEXT WRAP 

text-nowrap is a Tailwind CSS utility class that prevents text from wrapping onto the next line.

It sets the CSS property text-wrap: nowrap;.

The text will stay on a single line, even if it overflows its container (unless you also add things like overflow-hidden or truncate).

md:bottom-auto is a responsive Tailwind class.

Break it:

md: → apply this rule from the md breakpoint and up (medium screens and larger).

bottom-auto → sets the CSS property bottom: auto;.

So combined:

On small screens: whatever bottom-* value you set without md: is used (for example -bottom-20).

On md and larger screens: that bottom value is reset/removed (bottom: auto), so the element is no longer anchored to the bottom and will instead use top or normal flow for vertical position.

------------

space-y-5 is a Tailwind class that adds vertical gap between the children of a container.

Apply it on the parent div, not on each child.

It sets a margin between every pair of direct children on the y‑axis.

5 corresponds to 1.25rem (20px), so it becomes:

So: space-y-5 = “put 20px vertical space between each stacked child element.

In easy words:

This creates a custom utility class that cuts your image into a shape using a mask.

css
@utility masked-img {
  mask-image: url("/images/mask-img.png");
  mask-repeat: no-repeat;
  mask-position: center;
  mask-size: 50%;
}
Breakdown in simple terms:

@utility masked-img { ... }

Defines a reusable class named masked-img.

Now you can write: <img className="masked-img" ... /> and all the styles inside apply.

mask-image: url("/images/mask-img.png");

Uses /images/mask-img.png as a mask.

A mask is like a stencil:

White/opaque areas of the mask = keep/show the image.

Black/transparent areas = hide/make the image transparent.

mask-repeat: no-repeat;

Do not tile the mask; use it only once.

mask-position: center;

Place the mask in the center of the element.

mask-size: 50%;

Make the mask cover 50% of the element’s size (so the stencil is smaller than the full image).

What you should visually expect:

Without masked-img: your image shows completely as usual.

With masked-img: only the parts of the image that fall inside the “white” area of mask-img.png (at 50% size, centered) are visible; the rest looks cut out / transparent, creating a cool shaped image effect (circle, splash, blob, etc.), depending on the mask graphic


-----------------
So in plain words for you:

repeat = “copy this shape many times to cover everything.”
no-repeat = “use this shape only once (no copies), in the position/size I specify.”
